# Ankikado
Simple CLI flashcard program written in Python 3

Selected cards are added to a 5 card queue and will not be selected until it leaves queue to prevent immediate repetition

Made it for myself for some discrete studying, decided to share if anyone else wanted it :)

## Usage
Run with Python3

```
python3 ankikado.py
```

To exit, input "exit"

For custom cards, edit cards.json
